# SMSante
SMSante is an SMS app that allows users to text their town name to a number and receive back information concerning known Ebola outbreaks close to their location and the presence of hospital beds near them. It consists of two parts (spread in two repos), [SMSQuery](https://github.com/pamela-wu/SMSQuery) and [SMSBeds](https://github.com/pamela-wu/SMSBeds), because each one serves a different group of people and thus needs its own phone number. [SMSQuery](https://github.com/pamela-wu/SMSQuery) is geared towards regular citizens who want to inquire after information regarding outbreaks and beds, and [SMSBeds]() is for on-the-ground hospital and aid workers who want to use SMS text messages to update databases in real time.

Please check out the README of SMSQuery for full documentation on this app.
